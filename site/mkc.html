The Man Kiu College site hosts 1 socially-relevant and insightful program focusing on current-events, international relations as well as domestic affairs. Students participate in and contribute to multiple round table discussions. We feel that by having them talk about and carefully evaluate what happens around them, students will be able to hone their speaking skills and catalyse their english abilities.
