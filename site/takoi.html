The Tak Oi Site is Support!HKâ€™s inaugural site at Tak Oi Secondary School. Support!HK started operating a debate program at Tak Oi Secondary School in 2014. The style of debate taught at this site is consistent with the World Schools Style debating format. Students participate in internal debates, discussions and lectures that ultimately aim to strengthen their English skills. There are 40 students participating in this program, with 6 instructors teaching on site.
