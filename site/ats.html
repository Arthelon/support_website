Hosted at Aberdeen Technical School, this is Support!HKâ€™s second site. This program looks at sustainability and the environment, through an interactive project where students learn how to sustainably and efficiently design and run a city. In keeping with our goal to help students improve both spoken and written English skills, the entire program is taught in English. There are 36 students participating in this program with 4 instructors teaching on site.
