The Australian International School site is Support!HK’s newest site. Operated in partnership with The Boys’ & Girl’s Club Association of Hong Kong, this site hosts 3 english-related programs for its beneficiaries, who range from upper primary, up to high school students. All three programs centralise on the idea of improving the students’ english, both oral and written, through innovative methods of teaching. Digital learning, drama, and arts & crafts are just some of the methods we use to help the students take wider interests in what they are learning.
