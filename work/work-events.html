                        <h3>Youth Leadership Conference</h3>
                        <p>The Youth Leadership Conference is a conference that capitalises on giving back to the
                            community. As one of the few conferences that target highschool students, Support! believes
                            in taking the first steps in making a difference. We aim to redefine what it means to be a
                            youth leader, what it means to give back to the community, and what it means to have a
                            sustainable lifestyle. This conference provides the resources and guidance from various
                            professionals in the field along with networking opportunities with fellow innovators in our
                            local society.</p>
